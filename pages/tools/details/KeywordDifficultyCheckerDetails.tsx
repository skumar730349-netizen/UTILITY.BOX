            The Keyword Difficulty Checker is an essential SEO tool designed to help you understand how hard it will be to rank on the first page of Google for a specific keyword. It analyzes the competition and provides a score from 1 to 100, allowing you to prioritize your keyword strategy effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            By focusing on keywords with manageable difficulty, you can save time and resources, targeting terms where you have a realistic chance of achieving high rankings.

            <li><strong>Enter Your Keyword:</strong> Type the keyword or keyphrase you want to analyze into the input field.</li>
            <li><strong>Click 'Analyze':</strong> The tool will process your request and analyze the current top-ranking pages for that keyword.</li>
            <li><strong>Review the Results:</strong> You'll receive a difficulty score, an analysis of why the score was given, the likely search intent (e.g., informational, commercial), and a list of related, often less competitive, long-tail keywords.</li>
          </ol>

      tips={
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Target Low-to-Medium Difficulty Keywords:</strong> If your website is new or has low authority, focus on keywords with scores below 40 to build momentum.</li>
          <li><strong>Analyze Search Intent:</strong> Make sure the content you create matches the user's intent. If the intent is informational, a blog post is better than a product page.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Related Keywords:</strong> Incorporate the suggested long-tail keywords into your content as subheadings or supporting topics to capture broader traffic.</li>
        </ul>
